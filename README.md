# See-the-Future
My updated version of the, My Magic 8-ball project

This program removes the endless if statements of the 8-ball project by:
1. Creating a list of responses
2. Changing a response derived from a random number, to selecting a random response from the list
3. Creates a loop allowing the user to ask multiple questions
